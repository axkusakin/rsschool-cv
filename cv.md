### About me
I am 23 years old biologist. Since 2021, I am trying my first attempts at bioinformatics. I mostly perform analysis of a viral data, but as a "labor of love", I occasionally make my own bioinformatic tool. I also really like anything that is related to digital visual art, i.e. photography, movies, ux design and even websites (my top #1 is the [Aquarium](https://www.aquarium.ru/ru/) band website :) ). So I am interested in front end development and want to learn how to design my research attractively, and to output the result of my bioinformatics tools analysis as a beautiful html report.

        return 0
    for x in range(number):
        if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            summ += x
